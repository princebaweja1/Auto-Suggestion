**==================================TrieSuggester==================================**

**1. Overview**

a. TrieSuggester is an efficient auto-suggestion tool designed to present completion choices in a lexicographic sequence.

b. The project leverages the Trie data structure for fast and accurate suggestion generation, making it ideal for applications requiring quick lookup and insertion operations.

**2. Features**

a. Auto-Suggestion: Offers real-time completion suggestions as the user types, based on the prefix provided.

b. Lexicographic Order: Ensures that suggestions are displayed in a lexicographically sorted sequence, enhancing the user experience.

c. Efficient Data Storage: Utilizes the Trie data structure to efficiently store and manage a large dataset of strings, optimizing both time and space complexity.

**3. Implementation Details**

a. Programming Language: Developed using C++, making the tool performant and versatile.

b. Data Structure: The Trie (prefix tree) is used to store the dictionary of possible words, facilitating quick insertions, deletions, and search operations.

**4. How It Works**

a. Insertion: Words are added to the Trie structure, where each character is stored as a node. This allows for fast prefix-based searches.

b. Search & Suggest: The tool traverses the Trie to find all possible completions of a given prefix, returning them in a lexicographic order.
